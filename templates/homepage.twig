  This system was built to help people who are stalked online get a little more information about their stalker.
  <br/>
  The common usage scenario is as follows:
  <ol>
    <li>
      You have a stalker. You tried ignoring, blocking, reporting, but nothing works. It's time to get creative.
    </li>
    <li>
      Get a link of a video, image, article, or whatever you think your stalker might be interested in. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ">This</a> is always a good option, but anything works really.
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="/create">Put the link into the system</a>, and receive a new link and a key. Don't lose the key, because it's the only one. The system does not save a copy.
    </li>
    <li>
      Send the new link to your stalker with a small cover story, it could be something like "You're after the wrong person, you probably mean this one [include link]", or "Here's a picture of my earlobe, now leave me alone [insert link here]".
    </li>
    <li>
      When they will click on the link, their information about their location and environment will be collected and saved.
    </li>
    <li>
      After a reasonable amount of time had passed, <a href="/check">use your key</a> to check out the collected information
    </li>
    <li>
      If the stalker clicked on the link, you should now have their IP address, operating system, and browser, and whether they use an open proxy.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h1 class="content-subhead">Best practices</h1>
  <p>
    <ol>
    <li>In order to obscure the fact that you are using this system, after getting your link consider using a url shortener like
      <a href="https://goo.gl/">goo.gl</a> or <a href="https://bit.ly">bit.ly</a>.</li>
    <li>Make sure to send it ONLY to your stalker (via private message, DM, whatsapp, whatever) and DO NOT post it on a public environment. The whole idea is to have a unique link for 1 person, so posting it publically defeats the purpose</li>
    </ol>
  </p>

  <h1 class="content-subhead">Start</h1>
  <p>
    Simply <a href="/create">click here</a> and create a trap. Good luck!
